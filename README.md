# Salary-Prediction-
These is the machine learning project that predicts the person salary based on the feature like age, sex and few other features.
These is classtification based problem. so we will be using a classification algoriithm to achieve better machine learning model.
After some data cleaning like removing outliers, changing the the object to numeric values and appling feature enginnering, our data is now ready to make our model train and prepare.
Then atlast we will use our classification algorithm here in these case it is Standard Scaler.
We will train that model with the prepared data and predict it with the new data.
Then we will use accuracy prediction to know how good our model is on unseen data.
Our model predicted the accuracy score of 0.88. which is good start for our model.



#these is learing project and is not accurate i am a student learning machine learning
